# 🩺 PredictWell — AI-Powered Multi-Disease Prediction System

An end-to-end machine learning system that predicts chronic disease risk
(diabetes, heart disease) from patient health records, with distributed
preprocessing in **Apache PySpark**, model training in **scikit-learn**,
and a real-time interactive prediction UI in **Streamlit**.

**Live demo:** _add your deployed link here after deploying (see below)_

## What each stage does

1. **PySpark preprocessing** (`src/preprocess_*.py`)
   Distributed null/zero-value imputation (median, computed via
   `approxQuantile`), engineered features (BMI/cholesterol risk buckets,
   age buckets, glucose-insulin ratio, max heart-rate reserve), written
   back out as cleaned CSVs.

2. **Model training** (`src/train_models.py`)
   Trains Logistic Regression and Random Forest per disease, evaluates
   accuracy/precision/recall/F1 on a held-out test split, and saves the
   best-performing model + scaler + metadata to `models/`.

3. **Streamlit app** (`app.py`)
   Loads the saved models and serves an interactive UI where a user
   enters health parameters and gets an instant risk prediction with a
   color-coded risk badge.

## Measured model performance

> ⚠️ **Note on accuracy:** On these standard public datasets (768 diabetes
> records, 303 heart-disease records) with a held-out test split, the
> models we trained achieve:
> - **Diabetes (Random Forest):** ~75% accuracy
> - **Heart Disease (Random Forest):** ~80% accuracy
>
> This is in line with widely published benchmarks for these datasets —
> getting to ~90%+ on the *raw* Pima/UCI data usually means the split is
> too small/easy, features are leaking, or the model is overfitting.
> If your resume claims ~91%, consider either rephrasing to match these
> real, defensible numbers, or noting it as a stretch/aggregate figure —
> don't repeat 91% in an interview without being able to explain how you
> got it, since that's the first thing an interviewer will probe.

Run `python src/train_models.py` yourself any time to reproduce these
numbers — the script prints per-model accuracy/precision/recall/F1.

To re-run the full pipeline from raw data (requires Java + PySpark):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python src/preprocess_diabetes.py
python src/preprocess_heart.py
python src/train_models.py
```
